# DEFI-ti.me

> Note: This is the first draft of the projects white-paper.

## Abstract:
In short DEFI-ti.me is a unique and innovative way to tokenize and manage future.
Defi-ti.me's fundamental functionality is to provide a way to crowd-fund the future. 
Some other functionalities include ( but are not limited to ): 

- Investing in someone's time rather than buying/reserving or booking it. There are two kind of tokens: 1. `future-like tokens` with an **expiration time**, 2. `share-like tokens` without an expiration time. ( each of these have their own use-case and will be explained in detail later in this document )
- Book/reserve time, on someone's calendar, just like a traditional booking system (like Calendly for instance, on asteroids!).
- Democratizes the future. by removing gate-keepers from the equation and letting public shape it by supporting/investing directly in the future of individuals and other entities.
- Investing in long term relations, early on. ( In addition to supporting individuals by funding their future, you can also provide additional support in the form of mentoring or helping them to get closer to their goals, these depend on each individual token and what they are looking for )
- The token can be issued for other entities as well ( not only humans, but also supporting projects, kickstart products, or humanitarian efforts );

## Why?

- This provides an easy and secure way to invest in and fund the future of individuals, specially those with less social support and privileges.
- A complete time tokenization system like this was never implemented and there is potential for its success and adoption.
- Current solutions (like Calendly) are lacking features and very limiting, so there is a need and an opportunity to solve a real problem.

## Why Blockchain?

A block-chain based future tokenization system opens door to new features and opportunities that would not be possible otherwise.
In addition to obvious characteristics of a decentralized backbone, including security, censorship-resistance, and transparency, a few of other interesting benefits to this specific use-case includes:
- Discoverability ( based on user preference, they can enable the option to be found and booked/funded by anyone without having to send a link, the search criteria can include name, profession/categories, geospatial and proximity information and so on )
- Paid time reservation: made easily possible by the means of token exchange on the underlying blockchain network without the hassle of connecting a bank account or integrating with 3rd party payment services.
- Custom and flexible Booking Workflows by the use of smart contracts as plugins and extensions ( users can make workflows in an “If This Then That” style, to have automations, workflows and processes attached to their calendar. For instance, you can add a simple extension to send a custom notification when an appointment is made, add the event to other calendars, or to transfer funds from one account to another.
- Conditional availability planner ( You can for instance make certain time ranges more expensive or even have a minimum token requirement, for instance if you are selling a house with a minimum starting offer or just want to filter your clients based on different criteria in their accounts, you could, for instance by adding a minimum token requirement of 100 or so tokens in the clients account at the time of booking. Just like a proof of funds letter, only without the hassle.
- Possibility of tokenizing your time / future and exchanging it with your patrons/clients for your time. Like that people booking your time would be investing in it and could get a return on their investment over time. Incentivizing collaboration, planning, reliance on experts and team work.
- Data privacy: Once enabled only your private key can decrypt and make sense of your data, unless you make it public, no-one else can read it, not even DEFI-ti.me core team.
- It’s not just a calendar, The main underlying innovation in the DEFI-ti.me project, which makes it fast, cheap and flexible, is actually extendable to many other tools and projects. Not only extendable, but inheritable, meaning one account program can be used by many applications.

## Our goals:

- To create a platform that make it possible to invest in the future of less privileged, bright ideas, projects and good.

>We have a road-map with different phases and milestones, you can refer to the road-map section for more details about the timeline of these milestones.

## Flow:

> Note: there are many different, interesting use-cases of such system, here we are just briefing a few that help to explain the system with a user story:

- Kickstarter on steroids:
  Imagine a kickstarter-like platform, only decentralized. defi-ti.me provides this functionality out of the box, tokens can be generated for products, projects or ideas.
  For instance, let's say I invented a new gadget, but I don't have the resources to finalize and manufacture it, I can create a profile for it under the right category, add documents and description, and then let people who are interested in it, purchase my tokens and support the project, in the future, once the product is ready, token-holders can exchange their tokens to receive the actual product.
  To gain more trust from their supporters, token generators can add additional, off-chain, verifications and documents to their tokens, for instance, real Identity verification, Insurance, Guaranties, etc.

- Helping unprivileged in building their future:
  You are a young individual, from a socioeconomic class where traditional gate-keepers make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to make your future the way you imagine it. just like many of us, but together we can make it a bit easier.
  This platform will make it possible for you to work around the gate-keepers. you will go to the systems' portal, create your token, add a profile, add your ideas, your goals, how you are going to achieve them, potentially a road-map and any other supporting document/evidence to make your case.
  Then supporters can come and pick your resume/token, based on how well you may have sold it, and decide to support you. then the buy a certain amount of your token at its current price and accept all terms and conditions embedded in your token contracts.
  You receive the funds and start your project, be it paying for your college or starting your company.
  After some times, maybe a couple of years, during which you received additional support and became more successful ( closer to your goals ), your time-token is now worth more.
  You got to make your future, supporters got to make it possible and also got a return fot their investment.

## Roadmap

- Phase 1-1: (POC: Calenly-Killer!)
  Milestone: a demonstration of one of the use-cases of the system through a booking dapp.
  In this phase, we will demonstrate a POC that facilitate the booking mechanism though blockchain technology.
  DEFI-ti.me would be the first and only block-chain based booking calendar with potential of huge adoption and bringing a practical aspect of the block-chain technology into the day-to-day life.
  The goal of this phase is to increase awareness of the project, show some practical and familiar use-cases of it and build a base community of users, early adopters and developers, and also to start the formation of a core team to support the project.

- Phase 1-2: (MVP: Callendly-Killer)
  Milestore: make available a viable booking service based on block-chain technology that can compete with other tools and services

- Phase 2-1: Technical and architectural design of the network

- TBD... ( what comes next depends on phase 2-1 )

## Launch plan

`TBD`

## Solution details

- The time-token original owner, can receive a percentage of the transaction, each time it is traded. ( This does not mean this is an NFT. )
- The system can provide a platform to help the time-token original owner in the decision-making process, call to actions, making an audience/fan base or asking for advice or mentorship when needed.
- The time-token original owner, will always have the option to buy back the token at the expiration time at its current price plus a variable percentage set by the token-holder, or otherwise meet the token-holder
- Time Token supports meta-data, stored on the block-chain to hold additional details about the contract, for instance the token can be consumed during an in-person or virtual meeting based on these settings.
- The token will be destroyed during the meeting in a ritual defined and stored in the contract.
- The individuals putting their future on the support network ( market ) can confirm their identity to make their profile more trust-worthy, this (Identity verification) can happen through traditional means.
- The individuals putting their future on the support network ( market ) can configure their token settings
- plugins and extensions to extend the functionality of processes and workflows

## Token types:
There are tow kind of tokens:
- Tokens with expirations time: used for practical use-cases like booking time in someone's calendar.
- Tokens with-out ( or with far-in-the-future ) extension date: used for defi systems to crowd-fund the future
